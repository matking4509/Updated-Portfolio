      <p>I am a Jack-of-All-Trades brand of Nerd.  I have over 30 years of experience in various technologies and industries.  When I was starting my career it was valuable asset to have a broad understanding of as many technologies as possible.  So, I learned whatever I could get my hands on.  I sought out information in operating systems, databases, programming languages even hardware technologies and concepts in electronics and robotics.</p>

<p>This broad and varied view of things, has driven my career.  Growing progressively from entry-level customer support, to technology focused operations, into systems development and project management, and now into technical leadership. </p>

<p>Bringing this same approach to my education, I have a wide variety of unrelated Degrees and professional Certificates in Electronics, Technical Management, Culinary Arts, MBA, Scuba Diving, and as of this writing I am completing a Full Stack Bootcamp program at Georgia Tech.</p>

<p>Even my hobbies are eclectic; Including photography, backpacking, blacksmithing, motorcycles, cooking, scuba diving, and carpentry.  Some of those I'll explore more on this site.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot of lessons along the way, earning me version numbers from long time friends and colleagues.  Currently, I am at Mat v5.3.  I try to apply lessions learned across my interests.  It was surprising and interesting to find parallels in blacksmithing and cooking with project management and software development.</p>
